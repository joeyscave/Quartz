## Notes


## Highlights
> unopinionated
> #notes In the context of web frameworks, "unopinionated" means that the framework doesn't enforce a specific way of doing things. It doesn't provide a lot of pre-determined functionality or structure, leaving many decisions up to the developer. In other words, it doesn't have strong "opinions" about how you should structure your application or which libraries you should use.
> Express.js is often described as unopinionated because it allows for a lot of flexibility and customization. It provides the basic tools to create a web server, but doesn't dictate how you should organize your code, manage your data, or handle different types of requests. This is in contrast to "opinionated" frameworks, which provide a more rigid structure and set of conventions that developers are expected to follow.
