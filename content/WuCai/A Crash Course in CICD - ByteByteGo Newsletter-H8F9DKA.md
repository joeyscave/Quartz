## Notes


## Highlights
> Continuous integration involves automating builds, executing tests, and merging code from individual developers into a shared repository. The primary goal of continuous integration is to efficiently integrate source code into shared repositories.

> CD is the practice of automatically deploying every code change that passes the automated testing phase to production.
