## Notes


## Highlights
> But the elegant feature of promises is that then() itself returns a promise, which will be completed with the result of the function passed to it.

> await forces asynchronous operations to be completed in series. This is necessary if the result of the next operation depends on the result of the last one, but if that's not the case then something like Promise.all() will be more performant.
