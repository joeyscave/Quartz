## Notes


## Highlights
> For these reasons and more, we recommend that you use let in your code, rather than var

> JavaScript is a "dynamically typed language", which means that, unlike some other languages, you don't need to specify what data type a variable will contain (numbers, strings, arrays, etc.).

> Note that although a constant in JavaScript must always name the same value, you can change the content of the value that it names. This isn't a useful distinction for simple types like numbers or booleans, but consider an object

> Use const when you can, and use let when you have to
