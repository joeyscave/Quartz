## Notes


## Highlights
> almost any content can be made into a link, even block-level elements.

> It's possible to link to a specific part of an HTML document, known as a document fragment, rather than just to the top of the document. To do this you first have to assign an id attribute to the element you want to link to.

> Don't say "link" or "links to" in the link text — it's just noise.
