## Notes


## Highlights
> Every JavaScript framework offers a way to write user interfaces more declaratively. That is, they allow you to write code that describes how your UI should look, and the framework makes it happen in the DOM behind the scenes
> #notes html → js 创建 html → 用框架写类似 html，实际上转换为 js，然后 js 在运行时创建真正的 html

> When an SPA is complex enough, and renders enough unique views, it's important to bring routing functionality into your application. People are used to being able to link to specific pages in an application, travel forward and backward in their navigation history, etc., and their experience suffers when these standard web features are broken. When routing is handled by a client application in this fashion, it is aptly called client-side routing

> Server-side rendering (SSR) is an application architecture in which it is the server's job to render a single-page application
