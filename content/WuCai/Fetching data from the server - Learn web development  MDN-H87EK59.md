## Notes


## Highlights
> In the early days, this general technique was known as Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (Ajax), because it tended to request XML data. This is normally not the case these days (you'd be more likely to request JSON), but the result is still the same, and the term "Ajax" is still often used to describe the technique.

> It turns out that response.text() is also asynchronous, so we return the promise it returns, and pass a function into the then() method of this new promise.
