## Notes


## Highlights
> Strings declared using backticks are a special kind of string called a template literal. In most ways, template literals are like normal strings, but they have some special properties:
> you can embed JavaScript in them
> you can declare template literals over multiple lines

> You can include JavaScript expressions in template literals, as well as just variables

> Template literals respect the line breaks in the source code
