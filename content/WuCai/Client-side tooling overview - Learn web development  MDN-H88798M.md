## Notes


## Highlights
> From a high-level perspective, you can put client-side tools into the following three broad categories of problems to solve:
> Safety net — Tools that are useful during your code development.
> Transformation — Tools that transform code in some way, e.g. turning an intermediate language into JavaScript that a browser can understand.
> Post-development — Tools that are useful after you have written your code, such as testing and deployment tools.
