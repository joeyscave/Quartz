## Notes


## Highlights
> Which of these are state? Identify the ones that are not:
> Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it isn’t state.
> Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it isn’t state.
> Can you compute it based on existing state or props in your component? If so, it definitely isn’t state!

> Think of state as the minimal set of changing data that your app needs to remember.

> React uses one-way data flow, passing data down the component hierarchy from parent to child component.
