## Notes


## Highlights
> 2024 Updates
> I originally wrote this post in 2019. Coming back to this five years later, here are a few related projects which you might find interesting:
> I built a popular browser extension for Twitter, and wrote some reflections on using extensions as a way to fix problems in the software you use every day. I also touch on some of the downsides of the extensions platform in that post, if this one was too optimistic for your taste 😉
> During my PhD at MIT with Daniel Jackson, I developed a tool called Wildcard that enables non-programmers to build a browser extension in a spreadsheet.
> My friend Glen has also been working on a neat platform called ExtensionPay for monetizing browser extensions, for anyone interested in making an extension into a sustainable project.
