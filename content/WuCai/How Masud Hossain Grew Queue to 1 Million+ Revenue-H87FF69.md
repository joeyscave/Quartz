## Notes

> We joined the ones that had a lot of members and waited for someone to ask a question on how to do something. And then we would quickly answer it with a plug for our software, saying we’re way better than our answer.

> Cold outreach was definitely way less conversation than Discord. Most people are smart enough to know when they’re being sold to, so they always have a guard up. But you know what worked really well? Sending a screenshot or Loom video to prove we are not spam-blasting everyone. This increased our conversion by 300%.
