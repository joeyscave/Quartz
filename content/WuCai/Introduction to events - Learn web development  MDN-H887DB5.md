## Notes


## Highlights
> e.target — which is the button itself. The target property of the event object is always a reference to the element the event occurred upon.

> You can use any name you like for the event object — you just need to choose a name that you can then use to reference it inside the event handler function

> We describe this by saying that the event bubbles up from the innermost element that was clicked
