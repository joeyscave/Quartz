Due to the need to review my fleet thoughts, decided to try [Memos - Easily capture and share your great thoughts. Open Source and Free forever (usememos.com)](https://www.usememos.com/)
+ Deployment: [Self-Hosting - Memos (usememos.com)](https://www.usememos.com/docs/install/self-hosting)
+ visit at: [memos (yuankaiwen.site)](http://yuankaiwen.site:5230/)
+ Moe Memos can't access, due to "The App Transport Security policy of iOS requires HTTPS for your security." ([FAQ | Moe Memos](https://memos.moe/faq/)). To tackle this, use [acme](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E) to enable https on my site
	+ Need to place a file in the root directory of yuankaiwen.site (default 80 port), but I can't open this.
	+ Tried to boot tomcat. Not work
	+ Maybe due to I neglected Nginx? tried to boot nginx, error says 80 port conflicts
	+ The casue is actually I'm using Apache (httpd on centos) rather than tomcat or nginx
	+ Successfully enable https on default port
		+ install ssl file under /root/ssl (the path define by myself)
		+ add `LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so` in httpd.conf
		+ add `VirtualHost...` in httpd.conf
		+ useful links: [Where can I find the location in Apache2 for cert, key, and chain? - Help - Let's Encrypt Community Support (letsencrypt.org)](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/where-can-i-find-the-location-in-apache2-for-cert-key-and-chain/157340/3)
	+ But https still disable on other port :(
	+ Tried to use apache as reverse proxy (redirect request to http), but failed
	+ installed nginx proxy manager, assccible from: http://yuankaiwen.site:81/
		+ useful link: [【Docker 系列】一个反向代理神器 ——Nginx Proxy Manager | 我不是咕咕鸽 (laoda.de)](https://blog.laoda.de/archives/nginxproxymanager/)
	+ when generating ssl using nginx proxy manager, it errors "Internal error"
	+ At last chose the port forward rather than reverse proxy, add `location` in .conf file
+ Now can access memos via: https://yuankaiwen.site/
