Dear Mr. Zimányi,

I'm excited to be part of the BDMA program and to accept the Partner Country scholarship. I have attached the required proof of residence in this email. Both the original document and the notarized translation are included. Thank you again for this wonderful opportunity!

Warm regards,
YUAN Kaiwen
