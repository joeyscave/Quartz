+ [CloudFlare Tunnel 免费内网穿透的简明教程 - 少数派 (sspai.com)](https://sspai.com/post/79278)
+ Name the tunnel as dizhonghai
+ Using mac connector rather than docker
+ Change nameserver(primary DNS) of yuankaiwen.site to Cloudflare: [如何给你的网站套上Cloudflare（以阿里云为例）-CSDN博客](https://blog.csdn.net/zhyl8157121/article/details/100551592)
+ Change ssh config: [SSH · Cloudflare Zero Trust docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/use-cases/ssh/#connect-to-ssh-server-with-cloudflared-access)
+ Now can access dizhonghai with `ssh ykw@ssh.yuankaiwen.site`
+ It seems that if want to access on another device, it should configure ssh at first
