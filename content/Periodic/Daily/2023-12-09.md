Looking for [[../../z-Inbox/Obsidian|Obsidian]] publish alternative, links:
+ [10 Obsidian Publish Alternatives to Publish Your Notes Online for Free | Medium](https://beingpax.medium.com/7-obsidian-publish-alternatives-to-publish-your-notes-online-for-free-33db4fb06f5)
+ [Open-Source Obsidian Publish Alternatives (ssp.sh)](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/open-source-obsidian-publish-alternatives/)
Decided to try [[Quartz]] , #Software/Quartz 
+ doc: [Welcome to Quartz 4 (jzhao.xyz)](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)
Played around it, have:
+ exported several .md pages into content folder
+ changed some configurations, such as pageTitle, plugin.filter
+ tried private page feature
+ use symlink to integrate Obsidian seamlessly
+ change the footer in Footer.tsx file
+ use [[Cloudflare]] to host the website: [quartz.jzhao.xyz/hosting#cloudflare-pages](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/hosting#cloudflare-pages)
	+ [Joeyscave@outlook.com's Account | Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/f3751f86ac935016e3596ba6d2ac2d9e/pages/view/quartz)
	+ website address: [ðŸ¥³ Hiiii :) (yuankaiwen.site)](https://blog.yuankaiwen.site/)
	+ use `npx quartz sync` to sync
	+ use `npx quartz build --serve` to build locally
It can't substitute [[Notion]] completely:
+ can not display dataview
+ lack of collaboration functions
