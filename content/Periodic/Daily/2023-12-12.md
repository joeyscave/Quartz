Bought [[Hookmark]] on 闲鱼, cost ¥120

Tried several pdf apps for deep link in [[Hookmark]]:
+ Skim is shanty
+ Adobe Acrobat is somehow jagging
+ Nitro (downloaded from appstorrent) can't open

How to read a textbook that isn't for exam: divide and conquer
+ ~~~Use pdf/epub reader to read, highlight and take rudimentary notes~~~
+ ~~~Use xmind to summarize in own words and organize the logics~~~
+ [[Marginnote]] is unexpected cooperating with [[Hookmark]] quite well (support deep link), so maybe just combine the mindmap and pdf reader in Marginnote is a good idea
+ Use obsidian to archive and uniformly manage

Last night have read two chapters of [[Princinples of economics]] on [[Marginnote]], continue from here: [3.1 一个现代经济寓言](marginnote3app://note/3B624F6C-044F-4B20-97E1-2F786EB64479)

Read an article about [[PARA]]: [P.A.R.A. 的 Notion 实践](https://www.notion.so/P-A-R-A-Notion-19909e5aac3049d887197dcfb1e97fd5), feel inspired:
I have set areas in Things, but it's dead, I didn't allocate projects into areas, I can't review the progress I made and projects I have done within specific area, thinking about solutions:
+ ~~~Use things as a pure task manager, and use Obsidian as PARA manager.  ~~~ In this way I can't utilize the convenience offered by Things, and I think it is enough for organizing areas and projects
+ Use things to organize projects, areas and mind cache. Resources can't be organized in Things, but the category of resources is scattered, many of them can't be categorized into areas I set, so the separation of resources from Things may be a good idea
+ How to organize resources? 
	+ Readwise: trial made me can't use Reader as a vault 
	+ Obsidian: use daily notes to organize
		+ pros: all in one, can be easily referenced by other notes
		+ pros: no need for repetition of tag system
		+ pros: have more context and the comment of resources
		+ cons: not suitable for pdf / epub etc. resources
		+ cons: poor visualization, hard to be presented as a clean list or database
		+ cons: not convenient in collecting resources (but maybe leave notes to all links, assure them can be exported by Readwise Reader into Obsidian)
	+ Devonthink / Zotero
		+ pros: can manage various resources rather than just links
		+ cons: separated form notes (Hookmark as a remedy)
		+ cons: maybe better be used to field research
+ Final decision:
	+ Readwise + Obsidian: for resources I have already consumed and consider valuable
	+ Devonthink/Zotero: for field research and the future usage

Reflect on my current system and category in Things:
+ The two projects under "Indie Developer": "learn from other's experience" and "media" is actually resource rather than project, **action** → bind them to area as single tasks to serve as reminders 
+ How should I organize things under "Growth" such as learning about economics and research reports?
	+ Treat them as resources
