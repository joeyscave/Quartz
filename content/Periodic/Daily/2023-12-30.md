Try to beautify folder explorer of #Software/Obsidian :
+ Using iconize to add icons to folders
+ Using File Hider to hide [[../../index|index]]
+ This post disccused about custom sort: [File Explorer Custom Sort - Feature requests - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/file-explorer-custom-sort/1602/245?page=5), but I did not find elegant solution here
