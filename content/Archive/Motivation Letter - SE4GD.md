Dear Admissions Committee,

Since before college, my ambition has always been to become a software engineer, which explains why I chose Computer Science as my undergraduate major. With this goal in mind, I have dedicated myself to excelling in academic coursework, culminating in a GPA of 3.83 out of 4 in one of the most prestigious Computer Science programs in China, with a strong record in the top 10% ranking of most core courses.

Last year, I had the privilege of contributing to a project called the Intelligent COVID-19 Q&A System in collaboration with the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Understanding that COVID-19 information can often be scattered and lacking authority, our project aimed to create an intelligent Q&A system that delivers accurate and natural responses to COVID-19-related queries. Throughout this project, I engaged in various natural language processing and data-related tasks, including data processing of COVID-19 information from official websites such as CDC, ECDC, and WHO. By extracting question-answer pairs at different granularities and performing syntactic analysis of questions, I enhanced the generality of the Q&A system and finally achieved the desired effect. This experience allowed me to develop a strong foundation in engineering skills and contribute to a larger cause aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 3 - Good Health and Well-being.

More importantly, this project made me start thinking about how I can use my skills to benefit others and contribute to the sustainable development of our planet. I realize that while I have technical foundations, to truly make a difference, I need to expand my horizons and learn from a global perspective. This leads me to pursue a Master's degree in SE4GD program. This program’s goal to combine the sustainability mindset with software engineering tools and methods resonates deeply with my personal vision.  Besides, I’m also drawn to SE4GD’s special attention to employability and vast practical opportunities for applying my abilities to address real-world challenges. In short, I believe that the MSc program of SE4GD is the best place for me to develop and thrive. I’m eager to join the fall 2024 class and anticipate contributing to and benefiting from the SE4GD program.

Sincerely, Yuan Kaiwen
