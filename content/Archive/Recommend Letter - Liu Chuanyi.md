Dear Admissions Committee,

I am writing to recommend Yuan Kaiwen for admission to your master's program. I am Professor Liu Chuanyi from the School of Computer Science and Technology at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, and I have closely worked with Kaiwen during his undergraduate studies.

In the second half of 2022, Kaiwen enrolled in my Operating System course. Based on my observation of his assignments and projects, He is highly dedicated to quality and precision. He not only submitted work on time but also went the extra mile to ensure that every submission was of the highest quality, displaying a profound attention to detail. His initiative and enthusiasm also impressed me. To expand his understanding, he additionally completed all ten labs of the MIT 6.S081 Operating System course and actively sought and utilized other resources. He ended up getting a score of 92 in this course and obtained full marks in the lab section.

This semester, Kaiwen has been involved in contributing to the Synthetic Data Generator project, an open-source project I led. He introduced the implementation of the GaussianCopula model to SDG, adding an important brick to the richness of the framework. Throughout the project, Kaiwen demonstrated his communication and collaborative spirit. He actively discussed project details and was eager to share his insights and provide thoughtful feedback. His technical and learning aptitude is noteworthy as well. He is proficient in Python and has demonstrated an impressive ability to rapidly learn and apply new concepts. In line with the project’s needs, Kaiwen quickly mastered the Gaussian Copula model and proficiently utilized the PyTorch framework, proving his capacity to adapt and thrive in fast-paced and technically demanding environments.

Based on these experiences, I wholeheartedly recommend Kaiwen for admission to your program. I am confident that his academic excellence, work ethic, and motivation will make him a valuable addition to your master’s program.

Yours Sincerely,

Prof. Liu, Chuanyi
