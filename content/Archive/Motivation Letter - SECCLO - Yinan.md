Dear Sir or Madam,

As an undergraduate student majoring at Computer Science and Technology in Beijing Institute of Technology, I have built a solid grounding of computer science theoretical systems in operating systems, computer networks, software engineering, algorithms and computer architecture. Also, the broad university courses have significantly enhanced my abilities to learn and innovate, as well as entailed me the opportunity to trek different areas within computer science such as artificial intelligence.

Building expertise in computer science at my graduate level is a necessity, underlying which software engineering and machine learning are areas that particularly interest me. Such interests attribute to my project and internship experiences. It is worth highlighting the project - PSP: Pre-trained Soft Prompts for Few-Shot Abstractive Summarization that I joined. To support few-shot abstractive summarization, we aimed to design a soft prompts architecture, which includes continuous input embeddings across an encoder and a decoder to fit the structure of the generation models. Facing the challenging task, I learned some advanced language models such as PEGASUS and BERT. Further, PyTorch was applied for language model reference and training. With collaborative efforts, the soft prompts architecture we designed outperforms full-model tuning where all model parameters are tuned, which contributed to the final research paper included in International Conference, COLING 2022.            

Sailing against tricky problems in academic projects gave me great confidence to make practice in the real-world workplace, which enhanced my professional skills, as well as problem-solving abilities. During this summer vacation, I landed a job position at Shennan Circuits Co., interning as a software engineer. Here, I engaged in back-end development and database design. In the process, I often encountered problems that specific code could not be compiled. Though confused a bit, I always managed to calm down, think carefully, and independently address the problems through combining with in-class knowledge. Further, with a solid computing foundation, I found my strength in learning new technical frameworks, quickly grasping their structure and internal principles, and applying the framework to reality. Meanwhile, thanks to the internship, I have got a profound understanding of the ICT industry in the new era. Bearing this in mind, I am dedicated to diving deep into this industry and inspiring changes.

Together with the trend and my interests, I hope to focus on software design and development as a software engineer in the future, sparing no effort to help improve the existing software developing processes and realize robust software systems.

The MSc programme of SECCLO will equip me with the essential computing techniques that I need. For example, through taking courses, like _Cloud Software and Systems_, I can learn a series of advanced software systems theories. Also, I am attracted by the abundant practice opportunities provided by SECCLO, through which I will apply my skills to solve real-world problems. In short, I am confident that the education offered by SECCLO will help me thrive in my future workplace. And I sincerely hope to join the incoming class of 2023 fall.

Yours sincerely,
