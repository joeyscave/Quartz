I am pleased to write this letter in support of Kaiwen’s application for further studies at your reputed program. I have known Kaiwen for about two years, as his supervisor on the Intelligent COVID-19 Q&A System project and as his lecturer in the artificial intelligence course. He is an exceptional student and a gifted young engineer whose drive and dedication set him apart.

What impressed me the most during the project was his engineering fundamentals and problem solving skills. For the requirements of the project, he could quickly list feasible solutions and give well-reasoned choices after research. Beyond his technical skills, Kaiwen displays a positive team spirit and excellent communication abilities. He has often shown humility and openness to feedback, which foster a collaborative and effective working environment.

In the context of the artificial intelligence course, I noticed that he took the experiments very seriously. The documents he submitted were always detailed and accurate, and he always strived to achieve the best results and performance in the experiments. His attitude demonstrates his professionalism and sense of responsibility. 

In summary, Kaiwen stands out as one of the most promising students I have supervised. I have no doubt that he will excel in whatever he chooses to pursue next and will continue to innovate and contribute to the field. Without reservation, I extend my highest recommendation for Kaiwen’s application to your Master’s program, assured that he will be an asset to your academic community.

Yours Sincerely,
Dr. Tang, Bu Zhou
