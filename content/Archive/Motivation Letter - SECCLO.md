Dear Admissions Committee,

Since before college, my ambition has always been to become a software engineer, which explains why I chose Computer Science as my undergraduate major. With this goal in mind, I have dedicated myself to excelling in academic coursework, culminating in a GPA of 3.83 out of 4 in one of the most prestigious Computer Science programs in China, with a strong record in the top 10% ranking of most core courses.

In addition to my academic achievements, I have actively sought opportunities to enhance my practical capabilities. This semester, I participated in an open-source project called SDG ( Synthetic Data Generator ) and brought the Copula model as a statistical alternative to the GAN-based model for the project. Seeing my avatar appear in the list of contributors gives me a great sense of achievement. Furthermore, as a team leader, I contributed to a project called the Intelligent COVID-19 Q&A System in collaboration with the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Throughout this project, I engaged in various natural language processing and data-related tasks. By extracting question-answer pairs at different granularities and performing syntactic analysis of questions, I enhanced the generality of the Q&A system and finally achieved the desired effect. In addition, my curiosity about the financial industry drove me to undertake an internship at Uranus Research LLC, a multi-billion-dollar quantitative trading hedge fund in China. This involved intensive interaction with data, such as analyzing and modeling log data to establish anomaly detection logic, visualizing the data, and creating preliminary analysis reports. Although it differed from my initial objective of studying quantitative strategies, the internship was invaluable in broadening my understanding of trading systems and honing my engineering skills.

This year, my distributed system course led me to discover web3—a transformative leap from centralized to decentralized technologies where individuals control their data. This captivated me and propelled me to explore further. I’ve chosen to center my graduation thesis on the “Efficient and accountable research on decentralized anonymous credential protocol,” a cornerstone of the web3 and blockchain arena. Throughout the semester, my focus has been zero-knowledge proofs and anonymous credentials, cumulating in a recently submitted thesis proposal. This journey has reinforced my ambition to impact the evolving web3 industry and sculpted my career goals. I hope to emerge as an innovative software engineer shaping the web3 landscape by creating defining applications.    

SECCLO’s MSc program offers the tools I need. It promises an educational wealth in distributed system, information security, and software engineering, complemented with specialized electives in the second year. I’m also drawn to SECCLO’s vast practical opportunities for applying my abilities to address real-world challenges. In short, I believe that the MSc program of SECCLO is the best place for me to develop and thrive. I’m eager to join the fall 2024 class and anticipate contributing to and benefiting from the SECCLO program.

Sincerely, Yuan Kaiwen
