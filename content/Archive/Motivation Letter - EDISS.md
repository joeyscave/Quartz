###### Video script

Hi there,

My name is Yuan Kaiwen, a senior student majoring in Computer Science at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen. This video is to apply for the Master’s Programme in Engineering of Data-intensive Intelligent Software Systems.

My main motivation to apply for the EDISS program is based on my ambition which is to become a well-versed software engineer with a profound grasp of data and intelligence systems. EDISS program offers tools I need. It promises an educational wealth in data science, machine learning and software engineering, complemented with specialized electives in the second year. I’m also drawn to EDISS’s vast practical opportunities for applying my abilities to address real-world challenges. I believe that EDISS program is the best place for me to develop and thrive.

As for why should I be chosen to the program, well, firstly, I have dedicated myself to excelling in academic coursework, culminating in a 3.83/4 GPA in one of the most prestigious CS programs in China,  ranking in the top 10% of most core courses. And Beyond academic success, I have participated into many projects revolving around data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. This includes term projects, contributions to open-source community, a collaborative project with the National Center for Disease Control, and a professional internship. These experiences have equipped me with a deep comprehension of data-intensive systems and make me an ideal candidate for the EDISS program. 

###### Describe briefly your main scientific area of interest in the fields covered by EDISS?

Since before college, my ambition has always been to become a software engineer. After entering university, I became increasingly captivated by the thriving advancements in artificial intelligence. This burgeoning interest led me to participate into many projects revolving around data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. This journey has reinforced my ambition to become a well-versed software engineer with a profound grasp of data and intelligence systems.

EDISS program offers the tools I need. It promises an educational wealth in data science, machine learning and software engineering, complemented with specialized electives in the second year. I’m also drawn to EDISS’s vast practical opportunities for applying my abilities to address real-world challenges. I believe that the MSc program of EDISS is the best place for me to develop and thrive.

###### Explain in your own words how your background/trajectory makes you suitable for EDISS?

I have dedicated myself to excelling in academic coursework, culminating in a 3.83/4 GPA in one of the most prestigious CS programs in China,  ranking in the top 10% of most core courses.

Beyond academic success, I’ve pursued practical skills. I contributed to the Synthetic Data Generator (SDG) project by implementing the Copula model for the project. Leading a team, I worked on an Intelligent COVID-19 Q&A System, partnered with the National Disease Control Center, dealing with natural language processing tasks, refining the system’s question-handling capabilities to achieve our goals. Curiosity to finance drew me to intern at Uranus Research LLC, a major Chinese quantitative trading hedge fund, where I analyzed log data for anomaly detection and prepared analysis reports, which greatly expanded my engineering abilities.

To conclude, these experiences have equipped me with a deep comprehension of data-intensive systems and make me an ideal candidate for the EDISS program.
