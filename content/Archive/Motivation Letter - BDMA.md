Dear Admissions Committee,

I am Yuan Kaiwen, a senior student majoring in Computer Science at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen. I am writing to apply for the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree Program in Big Data Management and Analytics.

Since before college, my ambition has always been to become an independent developer, which explains why I chose Computer Science as my undergraduate major. With this goal in mind, I have dedicated myself to excelling in academic coursework, culminating in a GPA of 3.83 out of 4 in one of the most prestigious Computer Science programs in China, with a strong record in the top 10% ranking of most core courses.

In addition to my academic achievements, I got the opportunity to enhance my practical capabilities in term projects. My first term project, "Campus Life Manager," was a mobile application aiming to address various pain points related to campus life. I spent much time on database modeling during this project, striving to organize and manage the user data appropriately. As a result, this project won first prize in the term projects program. This semester, I participated in an open-source project, SDG ( Synthetic Data Generator ), as my second term project. I brought the Copula model as a statistical alternative to the GAN-based model for this project. Seeing my avatar appear in the list of contributors gives me a great sense of achievement.

Apart from term projects, I had the privilege of contributing to a project called the Intelligent COVID-19 Q&A System in collaboration with the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Understanding that COVID-19 information can often be scattered and lacking authority, our project aimed to create an intelligent Q&A system that delivers accurate and natural responses to COVID-19-related queries. Throughout this project, I engaged in various natural language processing and data-related tasks, including data processing of COVID-19 information from official websites such as CDC, ECDC, and WHO. By extracting question-answer pairs at different granularities and performing syntactic analysis of questions, I enhanced the generality of the Q&A system and finally achieved the desired effect. This experience allowed me to develop a strong foundation in engineering skills and contribute to a larger cause aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 3 - Good Health and Well-being.

These projects gradually sparked my interest in data science, especially how data is utilized in various industries. Eager to explore the application of data in finance, I undertook an internship at Uranus Research LLC, a multi-billion-dollar quantitative trading hedge fund in China, where I was in charge of developing a log monitoring system. This involved intensive interaction with data, such as analyzing and modeling log data to establish anomaly detection logic, visualizing the data, and creating preliminary analysis reports. Although it differed from my initial objective of studying quantitative strategies, the internship was invaluable in broadening my understanding of trading systems and honing my data-analytic capabilities.

These experiences have reinforced my belief that data science is crucial for informed decision-making, especially for independent developers and entrepreneurs. Realizing my lack of academic training in this area has led me to pursue a Master's degree in the Big Data Management and Analytics program, where I will acquire knowledge in BI and BD and further my expertise. Furthermore, the program combines the strengths of multiple universities and offers me the chance to network with a diverse group of people, providing diversity in curriculum design and exposure to various cultures, which convinces me that this program is the best place to develop and thrive.

Thank you for considering my application. I hope that I will be awarded the opportunity to have an insightful, exciting, and enlightening academic experience in this prestigious program. At the same time, I am also eager to share my experiences and collaborate with peers to enrich our collective understanding, thereby enhancing the vibrant learning environment. After graduation, I plan to apply the knowledge and skills gained from this program to support my entrepreneurial journey and make a meaningful impact in the field.

Sincerely, Yuan Kaiwen



P.S. (Clarification)

- My university does not have a web page showing the course details. Alternatively, the Academic Affairs Office sent me the scanned version of this curriculum, and I merged it with the transcript into one PDF. It is worth noting that this curriculum only includes all the core courses of my major, most of which are compulsory, and there are a few elective courses.
- I would like to clarify the reason why the GPA calculated in the self-evaluation sheet is much lower than the GPA shown on my transcript. This is because my university uses a CGPA algorithm (only including core courses in GPA calculation) and uses CGPA as a reference for graduate admissions and scholarship selection. Therefore, when choosing and arranging non-core courses, I solely based on my own interests and selected as many as possible. As a result, I have selected non-core courses that far exceeded the graduation credit requirements, and most of them were unrelated to my major. While enriching my academic experience, these electives have inadvertently impacted my overall GPA. I kindly request that the admissions committee consider these circumstances while reviewing my application.
