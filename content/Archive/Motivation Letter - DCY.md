Dear Admissions Committee,

As an undergraduate student majoring at Computer Science and Technology in Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, I have built a solid grounding of computer science theoretical systems in operating systems, computer networks, software engineering, algorithms and computer architecture. Also, the broad university courses have significantly enhanced my abilities to learn and innovate, as well as entailed me the opportunity to trek different areas within computer science.

Building expertise in computer science at my graduate level is a necessity, underlying which software engineering is the area that particularly interest me. Such interests attribute to my project experiences. My term project, "Campus Cafeteria Delivery Platform," was a mobile application aiming to solve the inaccessibility of takeaway delivery. I spent much time on database modeling during this project, striving to organize and manage the user data appropriately, optimize the handling of orders and menus. As a result, this project won outstanding award in the term project competition. This semester, my curiosity about the implantable brain–computer interfaces drove me to participate in a Electroencephalography(EEG) project, which aims to recognize different emotions in living beings by analyzing EEG signals. 做了什么事达成什么结果。This experience allowed me to develop a strong foundation in engineering skills and deeper grasp of processing and analysing data. 

Together with the trend and my interests, I hope to focus on software design and development as a software engineer in the future, sparing no effort to help improve the existing software developing processes and realize robust software systems.

The xxx track of CS program at VU&UvA will equip me with the essential computing techniques that I need. where I will learn how to utilize the raw data on the web better, how to extract valuable insights and patterns from large datasets, and master other techniques in the lifecycle of data. Furthermore, the program combines the strengths of the two universities in different areas of computer science, such as parallel computing and cybersecurity at VU, and artificial intelligence at UvA. This combination provides diversity in curriculum design, research projects and other aspects, which convinces me that this program is the best place to develop and thrive.

Thank you for considering my application. I hope that I will be awarded the opportunity to have an insightful, exciting, and enlightening academic experience in this prestigious program. At the same time, I am also eager to share my experiences and collaborate with peers to enrich our collective understanding, thereby enhancing the vibrant learning environment. After graduation, I plan to apply the knowledge and skills gained from this program to support my professional journey and make a meaningful impact in the field.

Sincerely, Ding Chenyang
